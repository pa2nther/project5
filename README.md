map 
This project uses the google map api to make a neighborhood of Outer Sunset in San Francisco. Information is also pulled from 
Wikipedia for additional information. Stackoverflow.com and the mozilla developer network were consulted as resources. The index is brought up to acess the map. Mjscript contains the code for the application and Mstyle is the css file.

This project uses the google map api to make a neighborhood of Outer Sunset in San Francisco. Some information is also pulled from 
Wikipedia for additional information. Stackoverflow.com and the mozilla developer network were consulted as resources. A few other sites may have been consulted but due to a computer failure, I do not have their links, but if I can find them will give them due credit.

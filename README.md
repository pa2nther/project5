map 
This project uses the google map api to make a neighborhood of Outer Sunset in San Francisco. Information is also pulled from 
Wikipedia for additional information.There are predetermined markers that are searchable known as Sites. Sites are listed on the side. The map can also be searched for places of interest in the 2nd search box. 

Stackoverflow.com and the mozilla developer network were consulted as resources. 

The index is brought up to acess the map. Mjscript contains the code for the application and Mstyle is the css file. The site is hosted on github
